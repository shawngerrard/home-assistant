#+title: Home Assistant Setup Instructions

This will take us through the steps of setting up Home Assistant on Ubuntu Server.


** Prerequisites

To use these instructions, you'll need Ubuntu Server installed on a machine, as well as SSH access (OpenSSH) to the server.

You'll also need to use the ~apt~ package manager.


** Specifications

I'm running Home Assistant on the following specs:
  - Raspberry Pi model 4b
  - Ubuntu Server 64-bit LTS 22.04
  - 3TB SSD mounted storage volume

*** Future updates:
***** TODO Change from single node infra to multi-node for high-availability.
***** TODO Replace Raspberry Pi with more powerful server hardware.
***** TODO Replace Ubuntu Server with RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

** Install Docker

To start with, we'll be running our Home Assistant application in a Docker container.

To install Docker, consult the official Docker [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/][installation instructions]] for Ubuntu.

For reference: I've installed Docker using their ~apt~ repository.

*** Future updates:
***** TODO Replace Docker with a single-node Kubernetes cluster.
***** TODO Install RedHat OpenShift (RHOS) over the top of Kubernetes to better orchestrate the platform.
