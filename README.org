#+title: Home Assistant Setup Instructions

This will take us through the steps of setting up Home Assistant on Ubuntu Server.


** Prerequisites

To use these instructions, you'll need Ubuntu Server installed on a machine, as well as SSH access (OpenSSH) to the server.

You'll also need to use the `Apt` package manager.


** Specifications

I'm running Home Assistant on the following specs:
  - Raspberry Pi model 4b
  - Ubuntu Server 64-bit LTS 22.04
  - 3TB SSD mounted storage volume

*** WAIT Replace Raspberry Pi with more powerful server hardware.
*** WAIT Change from single node infra to multi-node for high-availability.
*** WAIT Replace Ubuntu Server with RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).


** Install Docker

To start with, we'll be running our Home Assistant application in a Docker container.

*** IDEA Replace Docker with a single-node Kubernetes cluster.
*** IDEA Install RedHat OpenShift (RHOS) over the top of Kubernetes to better orchestrate the platform.
